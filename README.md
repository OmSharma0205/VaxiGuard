# VaxiGuard- 🛡️ Vacciguard – Smart Child Immunization Management System
Developed by: Divya Tiwari
📌 Project Overview
Vacciguard is a smart immunization management web application designed to streamline and digitize the process of child vaccination tracking. This system provides real-time vaccine slot synchronization, parent-friendly dashboards, reminder systems, and medical record management — all in one unified platform.

Built to address inefficiencies in traditional immunization workflows, Vacciguard blends modern frontend design, secure backend APIs, and healthcare scheduling logic to create a reliable and scalable platform.

🎯 Key Features
🗓️ Vaccine Schedule Tracking

🧾 Immunization Records and Printable Reports

⏰ Reminders and Notifications System

🧑‍⚕️ Role-Based Access (Admin/Parent/Healthcare Worker)

📊 Child Vaccine History Visualization

🌐 Responsive Web UI

🛠️ Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
React.js / TailwindCSS	Frontend UI
Node.js / Express.js	Backend API development
MongoDB	Database for storing user and vaccination data
JWT	Secure authentication
Cron Jobs	Scheduled reminders and alerts
Chart.js / D3.js	Visualizing immunization history

💡 Problems Solved
1. Real-Time Vaccine Slot Synchronization
Integrated backend logic to ensure that vaccine appointments reflect real-time availability, avoiding overbooking or missed entries.

2. Responsive UI/UX Across Devices
Used TailwindCSS to create a clean, mobile-responsive design that works seamlessly across phones, tablets, and desktops.

3. Frontend-Backend API Integration Issues
Handled async call delays, error boundary setups, and retry mechanisms to improve data accuracy between UI and server.

4. Authentication and Role-Based Access Control
Designed secure role-based workflows using JWT and protected routes, ensuring different views and permissions for parents, admins, and doctors.

💻 Screenshots
You can include screenshots of your UI here – dashboard, schedule tracker, report generation pages, etc.
